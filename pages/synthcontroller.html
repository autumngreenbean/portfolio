<h2>interactive development</h2>
<p>here I designed a hardware audio-to-video synthesizer controller, made out of found components. <br> I programmed an Arduino Uno to generate a series of visual arrays when connected to a VGA display. 
</p><img src="images/controller.JPG" alt=""><br> 
   <p> I programmed four buttons on this controller to cycle through different variations of the visual arrays.</p>

    <br>
<p>One special component to this project was the implementation of an additional input,
    a 1/4" audio jack, placed between the HSync and VSync channels on my custom-soddered VGA cable. <br>
  </p>

 <p>The result was a controller that accepts audio input and manipulates the visuals based off the audio's waveform signals.
    <br>For these examples, I used Spotify out of my mobile phone.</p>
    <table style="width:100%;">
        <tr>
            <td style=""><video src="images/controller-preview.MOV" controls autoplay muted loop width="100%"></video></td>
            <td style=""><video src="images/controller-preview2.MOV" controls autoplay muted loop width="100%"></video></td>
            <td style=""><video src="images/controller-preview3.MOV" controls autoplay muted loop width="100%"></video></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The result was a wonderful display of glitchy visualizations, integral to experimentations within video synthesis. </p>
