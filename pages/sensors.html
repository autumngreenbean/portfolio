<h2>Schematics!</h2>
<p>Projected to launch Spring 2025, I am designing an interactive exhibit.
</p>

<img src="/images/varation1.png" alt="" width="100%">
<p>The interactive exhibit integrates 12 VL53LOX distance sensors with two ESP-32 microcontrollers.</p>

<p>While my colleagues design and fabricate three sculptures to install the sensors on, I will fabricate this embedded system and create assets via sound enginnering to present sonically. <br><br>
    DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS: <br>
    One ESP32 will handle the collection of data from 12 laser sensors and manage the retrieval of .wav files from the SD card module. The second ESP32 will be dedicated to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) of the audio files and outputting the processed audio to external speakers. This division of tasks allows each ESP32 to focus on specific functions, reducing latency and ensuring smooth real-time processing, which is crucial for the interactive nature of the installation.</p>
